			    <h3>Task 1: Audience Profile Table</h3>
			    <table>
			        <tr>
			            <th>Age</th>
			            <td>I expect this project will be useful for a range of ages, and will be more dependant on the level of information literacy that the invdividual has, rather than age. However, I do not aim to cater this project to children, as plenty of resources are already available to them. </td>
			        </tr>
			        <tr>
			            <th>Gender</th>

			        </tr>
			        <tr>
			            <th>Education Level</th>
			            <td>I want to cater to those who perhaps do not have a higher education, as from my research, those are the ones that might be more suseptible to the dangers of online communities.</td>
			        </tr>
			        <tr>
			            <th>Knowledge of the topic</th>
			            <td>I am designing this as an introduction to saftey within online communities, therefore limited knowledge should be needed to understand the information presented.</td>

<h3> Task 3: Setting out my audience choice </h3>
<p>
After careful consideration and research into the current available resources for online saftey and education, I have concluded that my project would be best suited towards the older generation of individuals. As there is a gap in resources on online saftey for this audience.		</p>

	
 <h3> Task 4: Identify and evaluate websites </h3>

<h4> <a href="https://www.pudding.cool"> First website: Pudding.cool </a></h4>

    <strong>The Pudding - A Collection of Virtual Essays</strong>
    
    <p>The Pudding is a collection of virtual essays. The collection is easy to navigate, colorful, and exceptionally eye-catching. I noticed the lack of feedback options available on the site, which might prevent them from gaining consistent user-feedback. There are over 160 essays available, which are accessible either through a search or by scrolling.</p>

    <strong>Website Design Principles</strong>
    <p>In terms of website design principles, Pudding.cool excels in achieving the goals of contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. The essays are consistently presented with similar sizes, fonts, and visual flair.</p>
    
    <p>This design approach, however, comes at a cost. The website contains few sources, opting to embed hyperlinks instead. This design choice may cater more to its audience, one that is generally focused on reading the provided information and not delving into the sources. However, academics might find using the website for research challenging due to the lack of traditional citations.</p>

<h4> <a href="https://www.hrodc.com/"> Second website: hrodc.com </a></h4>

<p>This website is not user-friendly. It suffers from several design issues:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The color palette used is clashing, making the visual experience unpleasant.</li>
        <li>The font size is too large, resulting in an overwhelming amount of text that fills up the screen.</li>
        <li>The site lacks proper navigation options; scrolling is the only way to access the website's content.</li>
        <li>The website is cluttered with unattractive images and hyperlinks, creating a chaotic visual appearance.</li>
        <li>The information presented on the site is disorganized and appears to be randomly placed throughout the page.</li>
    </ul>


	<h3> Moodboard </h3>		
		<!-- Moodboard using the <img> tag with the external URL as the src and size attributes -->

	<p>For my moodboard, I have chosen to use <a href="https://milanote.com/">Milanote</a>. This platform offers several advantages:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>It provides a variety of tools that facilitate the organization of my ideas.</li>
        <li>It allows me to continuously add and edit my ideas as I gather more resources during my creative process.</li>
        <li>While my project is geared towards a mature audience, I explored resources related to children's internet safety. This broad exploration gives me a better understanding of the subject area.</li>
        <li>I hope that my moodboard will serve as a valuable resource, aiding in the reflection and maintenance of my project goals. It will play a crucial role in achieving a consistent design and user-friendly experience for the project.</li>
    </ul>
