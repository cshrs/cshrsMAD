		<h3>Task 3: The AWE Writing Process</h3>

		<p><strong>Reflective Statement:</strong></p>
	
		<p>Having examined the AWE (Assess, Write, Edit), I have come to the conclusion that I am in the D (Organize, Categorize, and Outline) stage of the Assess process. I have gathered plenty of resources that I can use and did have some prior background knowledge before beginning this project. Although, I am certainly in the earliest stage of this as I am yet to begin organizing my resources. However, I have defined my audience and purpose and conducted research. Therefore, to move forward, I just need to collate my resources and begin writing.</p>



		<h3> Task 4: Using Voyant-tools to explore textual content</h3>

			<p>
				Looking into the URL <a href="https://pudding.cool" target="_blank">https://pudding.cool</a> on <a href="https://voyant-tools.org" target="_blank">https://voyant-tools.org</a>,
				Voyant investigates the website's content and curates the most frequent words in a compilation of data represented in graphs and word-clouds.
				Inputting pudding.cool allows it to investigate the most common terms on the site. The result mainly came up with terms relevant to the content
				within the articles. And did not prove massively useful. However, what it does prove is that most of the content on the website is catered to current
				events or an event in time, which is useful in understanding the nature of the website; that it is there to inform the reader on a topic or period of time.

			<p>
				Although I found Voyant useful in providing brief context for the website <a href="https://pudding.cool" target="_blank">https://pudding.cool</a>,
				it was not as useful as the information I extracted from the professional writing characteristics format. This is because I could be more exploratory
				when I did my own research rather than relying on a tool, which proved limited in its scope.
			</p>

			<p>
				Within the findings, Pudding.cool has a very high reading index. I did get the impression from browsing the website that it was easy to read, with bite-sized chunks of information and straightforward language.  With an extremely low word count of 12.8 per phrase, it is clear from reading the website that you can find the information you need fast and with little effort.

			<h3>Task 5: Create Samples of text</h3>
			<h4>Opening assertion:</h4>
			<p>Welcome to my webpage on online safety for adults. In the brand new digital age, the net has grown to be a fundamental part of our everyday lives.
				While it presents us with infinite possibilities to learn, connect and create, it additionally poses some serious threats to our privateness, security
				and well-being. Adults who lack records literacy abilities are especially susceptible to those risks, making it important to educate ourselves and our
				loved ones on a way to stay safe online. On this page, we will explore a number of the most common online dangers and provide you practical guidelines
				and resources to help you navigate the net international with self-assurance and peace of mind.</p>
		
			<h4>Contextualising subject matter:</h4>
			<p>The net is a powerful device that has transformed the way we interact with the world. However, it's important to realise that it may also be a dangerous
				area, particularly for people who lack the essential statistics literacy competencies. By educating ourselves and our loved ones on how to live securely
				online, we will navigate the digital world with confidence and peace of mind. Remember to constantly be vigilant and take the necessary precautions to
				defend your privacy, safety and well-being. With the practical tips and sources provided on this page, you may be more geared up to revel in the benefits
				of the net while fending off its potential risks.</p>
		
			<h4>A key argument:</h4>
			<p>For adults with little online safety talents, it's crucial to first master all the basics. This includes using sturdy and unique passwords for each account, being
				cautious whilst clicking on links or downloading attachments, and avoiding oversharing private data online. It's additionally critical to keep software
				and protection systems up-to-date and to be aware about not unusual scams and phishing attempts. By taking those steps, adults can enhance their online
