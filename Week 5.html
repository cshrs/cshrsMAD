		<h3>Task 1: Evaluate Resources</h3>


		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Aspect</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>ACCURACY</td>
				<td>The visual essays on The Pudding website provide hyperlinks to the sources being discussed. This allows viewers to do further research into the topic they are reading about and go back to the original texts and content presented.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>ACTIVE VOICE</td>
				<td>The website primarily posts visual essays, but when introducing another facet of the webpage, like the mini description on the resources section, active voice is used.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>LIMIT BIASES</td>
				<td>The website does not curate for a specific gender, race, or age group. The visual essay titles are catchy and invite the audience to click on the essays, making them interactive and engaging.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>CLARITY</td>
				<td>The webpage uses precise vocabulary and graphics to explain topics. It is conducive to younger ages as well.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>CONCISENESS</td>
				<td>This webpage includes all types of visuals and is designed to make the reader want to visit more.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>CONVERSATIONAL AND SMOOTHLY FLOWING PROSE</td>
				<td>The website uses appropriate words directed to users. The use of "scroll right to start" includes us in the story and process of the story being told.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>CORRECTNESS</td>
				<td>All visual essays and writing on the website seem correct. There are not any poor grammar or spelling mistakes.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>PARALLELISM</td>
				<td>The website changes the names of the topics they provide essays on on the homepage.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>POSITIVE VOICE</td>
				<td>The website is very positive and engaging.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>STRONG NOUNS AND VERBS</td>
				<td>For the privacy data section, The Pudding states, "The Pudding does not keep personally identifiable data". This is a strong sentence that emphasizes data safety while using this website.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>SENTENCE VARIETY</td>
				<td>The sentences vary in length and are not repetitive in vocabulary.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>SIMPLE WORDS</td>
				<td>The type of vocabulary used is perfect for all types of audiences, including young adults.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>SHORTER PARAGRAPHS</td>
				<td>The visual essays are perfect for short attention spans. The topics are separated into short, concise paragraphs.</td>
			</tr>
	
			<tr>
				<td>TONE AND VOICE</td>
				<td>The tone and voice are informal in some ways and more formal in others, making the user experience more casual and personal.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
		        <td>ENGAGING CONTENT</td>
				<td>The website engages its audience with the words 'excellent study' and asks for their help: 'Can you help us reproduce this?'. The page has clarity and captures the viewer's attention using graphics instead of lengthy sentences.</td>

		<h3>Task 3: The AWE Writing Process</h3>

		<p><strong>Reflective Statement:</strong></p>
	
		<p>Having examined the AWE (Assess, Write, Edit), I have come to the conclusion that I am in the D (Organize, Categorize, and Outline) stage of the Assess process. I have gathered plenty of resources that I can use and did have some prior background knowledge before beginning this project. Although, I am certainly in the earliest stage of this as I am yet to begin organizing my resources. However, I have defined my audience and purpose and conducted research. Therefore, to move forward, I just need to collate my resources and begin writing.</p>
