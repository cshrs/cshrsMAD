<h3> Understanding Narrative Points</h3>

	<ul>
  <li>Raising Awareness: I want people to know about the dangers of online communities, like scams and cyberbullying.</li>
  <li>Practical Skills: I aim to raise awareness of how to stay safe online, like spotting scams and dealing with cyberbullying.</li>
  <li>Helpful Resources: I'll share extra help like helplines and support groups for those struggling with online safety.</li>
  <li>Boosting Confidence: I'll help people feel more confident in using online forums without fear.</li>
  <li>Engagement: I'll encourage folks to share their stories and questions so I can tailor my content to their needs.</li>
  <li>Spread the Word: I'll want people to share what they learn to make the internet safer for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<p> These narrative points, set out the aims I have with the project. Orchastrating a narrative that helps checks this targets is my overall goal for the project. The best way to do this would be to provide information in the most engaging way possible, so that the information is easy to access and take in. This can be done by taking careful considerations of my website design, making sure the overall design is the most important factor.
