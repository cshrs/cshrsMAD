		<h2>Week 3: Establish your narrative and file structure</h2>

			<h3>Task 1: Understanding Narrative Points and Creating a Plan</h3>
		
			<strong>Chosen Reading: <a href="https://onextrapixel.com/applying-visual-storytelling-to-website-designs/">Applying Visual Storytelling to Website Designs</a></strong>
		
			<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
			<p>The article discusses the use of visual cues to convey a message and create a tone for website design. It delves into using typography, emoticons, and thematic experiences to develop a narrative, providing examples along the way.</p>
				
			<strong>Visual Storytelling</strong>
			<p>Visual storytelling uses visual cues to create patterns that inform viewers. It can be applied to website designs through the selection of icons, typography, photography, and interaction to support the story.</p>
		
			<strong>How can interactive elements be used to convey a message?</strong>
			<p>Interactive elements can convey a message by allowing users to control the narrative and explore the possibilities of the web as a communications medium. This can be achieved through non-linear navigation, animations, and interactive puzzles.</p>
		
			<strong>How can the tone of a website be established?</strong>
			<p>The tone of a website can be established through mood boards, typography, and descriptive keywords. Mood boards help gather design elements like colors, textures, typography, and shapes to set the tone. Typography conveys modernity or traditionalism, while descriptive keywords provide creative direction and multiple angles for the client's project.</p>
		
			<strong>What are some tips for effectively communicating a story to an audience?</strong>
			<p>Tips for effective storytelling include writing in the first-person for personal content and third-person for corporate content, structuring content in a personable and objective manner, and using visuals to enhance the story.</p>
		
			<h3>Task 2: Incorporate the Narrative Plan into Your Portfolio</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Raising Awareness: I want people to know about the dangers of online communities, like scams and cyberbullying.</li>
				<li>Practical Skills: I aim to raise awareness of how to stay safe online, like spotting scams and dealing with cyberbullying.</li>
				<li>Helpful Resources: I'll share extra help like helplines and support groups for those struggling with online safety.</li>
				<li>Boosting Confidence: I'll help people feel more confident in using online forums without fear.</li>
				<li>Engagement: I'll encourage folks to share their stories and questions so I can tailor my content to their needs.</li>
				<li>Spread the Word: I'll want people to share what they learn to make the internet safer for everyone.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>These narrative points set out the aims I have for the project. Orchestrating a narrative that helps check these targets is my overall goal for the project. The best way to do this would be to provide information in the most engaging way possible, so that the information is easy to access and take in. This can be done by taking careful considerations of my website design, making sure the overall design is the most important factor.</p>
		
			<p>Overall my design considerations are: accessiblity, ease of navigation, simplistic display of information and non-contrasting colours. I have found the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/">W3 accessability guidelines</a> which I can use to design my website to make it as accessible as possible.</p>
			<h3>Setting up My File Structure</h3>
			<p>My experience with HTML is fairly limited, but I am confident in my abilities. I have, therefore, decided to mostly ignore the given template and use it sparingly. This will help me have more creative control over the website files.</p>
