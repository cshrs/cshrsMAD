		<h3>Task 1: Analyse the use of audio on the Web</h3>

		<h4>Selected websites:</h4>

		<p><a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us/interland/tower-of-treasure">BeInternetAwesome</a> is a multimedia interactive game designed to teach people, primarily children, about online safety and digital citizenship. Audio is used for sound effects, ambient sound, and speech elements. The use of multimedia elements makes learning fun and memorable, promoting digital citizenship and equipping children with the skills to navigate the online world safely. Audio enhances the immersive learning experience, creating a realistic and engaging environment.</p>
		<p>Audio is combined with video and images to provide a dynamic and well-rounded learning experience, catering to different learning styles. The use of sound effects and ambient sound creates a sense of place within the game. Speech elements offer instructions and feedback, aiding user understanding. BeInternetAwesome demonstrates the advantages of incorporating audio into multimedia productions for educational purposes.</p>

		<p><a href="https://swgfl.org.uk/resources/online-safety-podcast/">SWGFL</a> hosts an online safety podcast accessible within the website or via audio streaming platforms. The podcast provides information on various online safety topics, offering an advantageous option for users who prefer auditory learning. It covers topics such as protecting personal information, avoiding scams, and navigating social media. The podcast is beneficial for parents, educators, and anyone interested in staying safe online.</p>
		
<p>I used my findings to augment my moodboard which can be found <a href="Resources.html"> here.</a> </p>


<h3>Task 2: Generate a portfolio of audio content</h3>

<p>Using my moodboard, I found two audio files from the <a href="https://sound-effects.bbcrewind.co.uk/"> BBC sound effects archive</a> that I believe would be useful in my website, I chose these files as I believe they can be edited in a way that enhances the accesability of the website. The audio can be played below. </p>


<h4> Button 1</h4>
<audio controls>
	<source src="Resources/button1.wav" type="audio/wav">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<h4>Button 2</h4>
<audio controls>
	<source src="Resources/button2.wav" type="audio/wav">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<h3>Task 4: Optimise your audio for Web use</h3>
<p>This task saw me use <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> to edit and trim content from my selected audio files and then export them. I also played around with the other tools in Audacity; such as changing the volume of the tracks. Changing these will have an impact of the usefulness of the audio, making it louder will allow users who might be hard of hearing (such as older invdivduals), to be able to hear the audio.</p>

<h4>Button 1 shortened</h4>
<audio controls>
	<source src="Resources/button1eshort.wav" type="audio/wav">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<h4>Button 1 shortened with volume increased using gain tool</h4>
<audio controls>
	<source src="Resources/button1eshortgain.wav" type="audio/wav">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<h4>Button 2 shortened</h4>
<audio controls>
	<source src="Resources/button2eshort.wav" type="audio/wav">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<h4>Button 2 shortened and slowed using slow tool</h4>
<audio controls>
	<source src="Resources/button2eshortslowed.wav" type="audio/wav">
	Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>


<p>Having played around with my audio files, I feel like I have created and have access to audio files that can be used within my project that supplment my webpage and help promote its accessability. Furthermore, I now have the skills to edit and use audio for future purposes within this project. Audacity proved simple to use and there were plenty of resources availble online that helped with editing.</p>
